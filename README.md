## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

Here you will find a variety of example codes done in MAGD 150 at UW-Whitwater.

### Example 1
[Outer Space](https://github.com/MeyerKalei/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Black%20and%20White%20Compositions.pde)

This code is a black and white composition of outer space. It encorporates a varity of lines, shapes, and various black and white hues within the enirity of the sketch. 

### Example 2 
[Balloons](https://https://github.com/MeyerKalei/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Color%20Composition.pde)

This code is a color composition featuring balloons. It includes multiple different colors as well as compositional elements such as bezier curve and arc. 

### Example 3 
[Oceans](https://github.com/MeyerKalei/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Dynamism.pde)

This code is a dynamism composition of an ocean. It uses elements such as mouse pressed and key pressed that work to change the colors of various aspects of the sketch when the user interacts with their keyboard and mouse. It also uses an abundance of loops that are used to create the waves. 

### Example 4 
[Menus to an Alternate Dimension](https://github.com/MeyerKalei/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/Intersections.pde)

This code is an intersectional composition that portrays an alternate dimension. It includes two buttons that each bring up a different smiley face colored dimension when clicked on by the user. Additionally, it encorporates bright colors throughout the sketch to make it pop out and seem interdimensonal. 

### Example 5 
[Nature](https://github.com/MeyerKalei/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/s18_magd150_lab07_Meyer)

This code works with transformations to create a nature scene. It uses arrays to create rain and uses aspects such as push and pop matrix's to apply transformations to different shapes within the sketch.
